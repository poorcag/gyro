# gyro
WebRTC gyroscope controller + Babylon.JS

### Idea

Use WebRTC to set up a direct connection between a mobile and web UI and transfer live gyroscope data

Babylon.JS demo too?



TODO:
 - use QR code to transmit connection details from the host to the phone
 - these can be used to negotiate the direct connection
